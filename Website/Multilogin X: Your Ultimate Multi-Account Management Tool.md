## Best Practices for Multi-Accounting

Thinking of running ad campaigns or managing multiple accounts? Follow these essential tips to avoid bans and detection:

1. **Use High-Quality Proxies:** Opt for residential or mobile proxies to ensure secure and undetectable browsing.
2. **Leverage Cookies:** Importing and using cookies for each profile mimics regular user behavior. This is critical for avoiding red flags.
3. **Warm Up Your Accounts:** Newly created accounts lack historical data, making them more prone to bans. Take time to warm them up with consistent and realistic activity.
