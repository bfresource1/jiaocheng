## Different Types of Multilogin Techniques

Multilogin employs various advanced techniques to create and manage isolated virtual identities effectively.

### Cookie Isolation

Each browser profile has its own isolated cookie storage. This prevents cross-tracking between profiles, ensuring privacy and preventing websites from linking user activities across different accounts.

### IP Address Rotation

By leveraging proxy servers or VPN services, users can rotate their IP addresses for each browser profile. This technique is ideal for region-specific tasks, bypassing IP-based restrictions, or achieving anonymity online.

### User-Agent Spoofing

This feature allows users to mimic different devices, browsers, and operating systems. It helps overcome browser-specific restrictions, access device-specific content, and simulate a diverse set of users.

### Canvas Fingerprint Manipulation

Multilogin modifies the browser’s Canvas fingerprint to make each profile appear unique. This technique reduces the risk of browser fingerprinting and tracking by websites.

### WebRTC IP Handling

Multilogin ensures consistency between a user’s actual IP address and the one reported via WebRTC, preventing IP leaks across browser profiles.
