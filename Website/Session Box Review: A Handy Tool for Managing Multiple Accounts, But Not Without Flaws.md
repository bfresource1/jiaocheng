## What is Session Box?

[Session Box](https://sessionbox.io/) is a browser extension that allows users to log in to multiple accounts on the same website without switching browsers or using private/incognito mode. It works seamlessly on major browsers like **Chrome**, **Opera**, **Mozilla Firefox**, and even offers a standalone app for **Windows**. 

For instance, you can manage two Facebook accounts simultaneously within the same browser, saving time and reducing the hassle of switching between browsers or private windows.

## Downsides of Session Box

While Session Box is a great tool, it comes with a few notable drawbacks:

1. **Session Persistence Issues**  
   Saved tabs or bookmarks of sessions created with Session Box do not retain their associated login. When reopened, these tabs default to your primary browser account, making it inconvenient for heavy tab users.

2. **Clunky Workflow for Links**  
   You cannot directly open a link with an already created session profile. To open a specific link in a session, you must first open the session manually and then paste the link into the address bar—a process that could be streamlined.

3. **No Mobile Version**  
   Although mobile devices often allow multiple accounts in apps, the lack of a mobile version of Session Box limits its utility for users who rely heavily on mobile browsing.

## Is the Premium Version Worth It?

Session Box offers a premium subscription plan, but its current features may not justify the price for all users. The absence of a trial option further complicates the decision to upgrade.

Heavy users who manage 50-100 tabs at a time may find its limitations frustrating, such as the inability to save specific session data or open links directly with a session profile. While the tool is handy for everyday use, these shortcomings might drive advanced users toward more feature-rich alternatives.

## Conclusion

Session Box is undoubtedly a game-changer for managing multiple accounts within a single browser. Its ability to isolate sessions and reduce resource usage makes it an essential tool for casual users. However, its limitations, such as session persistence and link-handling inefficiencies, hold it back from being a comprehensive solution.

For those who need more robust features, **Multilogin** offers a more advanced alternative with better session management and security capabilities.
