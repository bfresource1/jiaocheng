# How to Run Multiple Amazon Seller Accounts: Expert Tips for 2025

Running multiple Amazon seller accounts can help dropshippers and e-commerce sellers scale their businesses, segment product categories, and diversify risks. However, Amazon's strict algorithms can link your accounts if they detect connections, leading to potential account suspensions. In this guide, we’ll outline how to safely manage multiple Amazon accounts while adhering to Amazon’s policies.

## Why Have Multiple Amazon Seller Accounts?

Managing multiple accounts offers several benefits:

- **Scale Your Business**: Expand operations and reach more customers.
- **Specialized Product Segmentation**: Create separate accounts for different brands or product lines for a more focused shopping experience.
- **Diversify Risks**: Minimize dependency on one account to ensure business continuity in case of issues.

While Amazon permits multiple accounts for legitimate business needs, it is essential to ensure they are not linked in any way. If one account is restricted, Amazon’s algorithms may flag and suspend related accounts.

## Amazon’s Rules for Multiple Accounts

Amazon permits multiple accounts if you have a **legitimate business need**, such as:

- Managing separate brands under different accounts.  
- Operating accounts for distinct companies or business entities.  

However, even if your reasons are valid, associations between accounts—like shared IPs, names, or payment methods—can lead to account restrictions.

### Risks of Account Linking

Your accounts may be flagged as related due to the following associations:

- Shared names or business entities.  
- Common payment methods or IP addresses.  
- Overlapping devices, cookies, or browser fingerprints.

Amazon’s algorithms may make mistakes or misinterpret these associations, resulting in account bans. To avoid downtime, it’s critical to eliminate ties between your accounts.

## How to Safely Manage Multiple Amazon Accounts

### 1. Use Proxies for IP Separation

A **proxy server** acts as an intermediary, masking your real IP address and location. Assigning different proxies to each account ensures that Amazon cannot link them based on IP data.

#### Key Tips for Proxy Use:
- Assign a unique proxy for each browser profile.  
- Avoid free proxies, as they can compromise your data security.  
- Invest in high-quality residential proxies for greater reliability.  

However, proxies alone are insufficient due to Amazon’s advanced tracking methods, such as browser fingerprinting.

### 2. Multi-Accounting Browsers: The Ultimate Solution

A **multi-accounting browser** is a secure tool that isolates browser sessions, allowing you to manage multiple accounts with distinct identities. These browsers mask your digital fingerprints, ensuring each account appears unique to Amazon.

#### Key Features of Multi-Accounting Browsers:
- **Isolated Profiles**: Each browser profile operates independently with unique cookies, device parameters, and IP settings.  
- **Browser Fingerprint Management**: Prevents Amazon from linking accounts based on hardware or software configurations.  
- **Custom Extensions**: Create personalized bookmarks and tools for each account.
