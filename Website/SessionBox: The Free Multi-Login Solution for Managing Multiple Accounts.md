## What Is SessionBox?

**SessionBox** is a browser extension that allows you to log into multiple accounts on the same website simultaneously without needing additional browsers or private sessions. By creating independent tabs for each session, SessionBox makes managing multiple accounts straightforward and secure.

### Key Features:
- **Multiple Active Sessions**: Log into different accounts on the same site simultaneously using one browser.  
- **Session Synchronization**: Sessions are securely synced across devices, so you can start a session on one device and continue it on another.  
- **Privacy Protection**: Tabs managed by SessionBox do not use shared storage. Variables are handled by the extension, ensuring that other tabs or websites cannot monitor your activity.

## How Does SessionBox Work?

1. **Independent Tabs**: With just one click, you can create a new tab with an independent session for a specific account.  
2. **No Shared Storage**: Each session operates separately, avoiding conflicts between accounts.  
3. **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Sessions are linked to your SessionBox account, allowing seamless transitions between devices.  

For instance, instead of using multiple browsers or private windows, SessionBox allows you to open various accounts side-by-side in one browser.
