Managing multiple Google accounts or lending your Android device temporarily? Android offers a built-in feature to add multiple users and even a Guest mode to accommodate such needs. This guide will show you how to set up multiple users and use Guest mode effectively.

## Why Use Multiple User Accounts or Guest Mode?

Android devices are versatile, supporting multiple user accounts for personalized use. With this feature, each user can have their own:

- **Custom Settings**: Wallpapers, homescreens, and preferences.
- **Separate Storage**: Photos, files, and apps stored independently.
- **Individual App Access**: Manage apps without interference from others.

For temporary access, **Guest mode** is an excellent alternative. It allows access to general apps like Chrome or YouTube without the need for signing into an account. Plus, you can wipe guest data instantly after use for enhanced privacy.

## Child Accounts on Android Tablets

For tablets, Android supports adding child accounts linked to **Google Family Link**. This allows you to set parental controls and manage your child’s activity. Note that this feature is exclusive to tablets and cannot be set up on phones.

## Additional Notes

- **Samsung Devices**: Samsung’s Android 13 One UI does not currently support multiple-user accounts.
- **Setup Requirements**: When adding a new user, you must follow the same steps as setting up a new Android device, including signing in to a Google account and configuring lock screen security.
