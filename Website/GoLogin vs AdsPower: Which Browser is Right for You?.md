## Advanced Fingerprint Spoofing for Maximum Undetectability

### Operating Systems Supported

Both AdsPower and GoLogin support major operating systems, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. However, AdsPower takes it a step further with its **multikernel approach**, ensuring seamless compatibility and undetectability.

AdsPower’s [multikernel method](https://www.adspower.com/blog/AdsPower-Only-Multikernels-Update-Higher-Undetectability-and-Less-Discrepancies) ensures that fingerprints and browser kernel versions are consistent, minimizing discrepancies that could trigger detection by websites.

### Browser Kernels and Version Updates

- **AdsPower**: Comes with SunBrowser (Chromium kernel), updated to Chrome 120, and FlowerBrowser for Firefox support.  
- **GoLogin**: Uses Orbita Browser (Chromium kernel), but the latest version remains at Chrome 119. It does not support Firefox-based kernels.  

By offering both Chromium and Firefox kernels, AdsPower provides greater flexibility and undetectability for users with different needs.

## Pricing: Flexibility Matters

**GoLogin** offers four fixed plans, starting at $24/month for 100 profiles. While the pricing is competitive, it lacks customization options, making it less ideal for users with specific needs.

**AdsPower**, on the other hand, is known for its **affordability and flexibility**. Users can customize the number of profiles and member seats, ensuring they only pay for what they need. This makes AdsPower suitable for businesses of all sizes, from solopreneurs to enterprises.

## Automation: Streamlining Your Workflow

### API and Task Automation

- **AdsPower**: Provides pre-built templates for platforms like Facebook and Amazon. Non-coders can automate workflows without technical skills.  
- **GoLogin**: Requires programming skills to use its API for automation, making it less accessible for beginners.

---

### Action Synchronizer

AdsPower offers a **Synchronizer** feature, allowing users to replicate actions across multiple profiles. This is ideal for account managers, marketers, and gamers who need to control multiple windows simultaneously.

GoLogin lacks an equivalent feature, making AdsPower the winner in this category.

---

## Security and Privacy: Keeping Your Data Safe

AdsPower prioritizes user security with advanced features, including:

- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)  
- Remote Login Alerts  
- Failed Login Attempt Notifications  
- Customizable Login IP Allowlist  

While GoLogin offers basic two-step verification, it does not provide the same level of advanced security settings as AdsPower.

---

## Bulk Management and Extensions

### Bulk Operations

AdsPower allows users to create, manage, and launch multiple profiles in bulk, grouped by custom categories. GoLogin, however, does not support bulk creation and management, limiting its scalability.

### Extensions

AdsPower includes a marketplace of recommended and self-developed extensions, allowing users to enhance their workflows. GoLogin currently lacks an in-app extension market, making AdsPower the more versatile choice.

## Final Verdict

Both AdsPower and GoLogin are strong contenders in the anti-detect browser market. However, AdsPower’s **flexibility, advanced features, and security enhancements** give it a clear edge. From seamless automation to robust privacy measures, AdsPower caters to a wide range of user needs, making it the better choice for most users.
